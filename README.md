Hi, I'm Simon 👋

I'm a data analyst with a background in systems management and an interest in ML technologies.

Here's some recent stuff I've been working on:

**Data Analysis:**
- **[VS-Code-PR-Analysis](https://simonpurdie.github.io/VS-Code-PR-Analysis/)** - Analyzing pull request patterns in one of the world's largest open-source projects
- **[understanding-semantic-analysis](https://github.com/SimonPurdie/understanding-semantic-analysis)** - Educational exploration of semantic analysis fundamentals using modern ML tools

**Personal Projects:**
- **[cuniculus](https://github.com/SimonPurdie/cuniculus)** - Python cleanup tool for "vibecode" with automated fixes and review reports.
- **[Miyori](https://github.com/SimonPurdie/Miyori)** - An experimental LLM harness with components built from scratch to explore modern agentic AI techniques.
